If you click on the download button in the browser, you can have this app as downloadable web app.
Otherwise you can clone the repo:

```
Then you will see the website on the browser.

## Usage

First when you open the app, you will see the homepage, with a navbar

you will see a category menu and an option for skatedecks.

When you click the navigation links you will be redirected

to the shop page, with all the products and a category page, where you can see all the categorys again.

If you click one of the category, you will only see the products of that specific category.

In the navbar you can also see three icons --> a login icon, a sign up icon and a cart (only available once logged in)

Once you login/signup, you will be able to use the cart functionality.

If you click one of the products from the shop or catgory page, you can see the details of that single product.

Press on the add to cart icon to add an item to the cart.

Once you press on the cart icon on the top right, you can see all the current items in the cart.

You can increment or decrement the number of items per product you want to buy and can also remove items from the cart.

Once you click on the checkout, you will be redirected to stripe and you can test the stripe portion as well.

Use the test card 4242 4242 4242 and fill in the rest of the values.

Then you can press on buy and the stripe will handle the payment.

Happy Shopping!
